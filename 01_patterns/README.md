# 01_patterns

### Purpose

The `01_patterns` directory contains a collection of C++ programs focused on printing different patterns using loops and basic control structures. These pattern problems are a classic starting point for anyone beginning their journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). They help build a strong foundation in:

- Understanding nested loops
- Mastering control flow
- Developing logical thinking for problem-solving

### Why Start with Patterns?

Pattern-printing problems are ideal for beginners because:
- They reinforce the basics of programming (loops, conditionals, functions).
- They improve your ability to visualize code execution.
- They prepare you for more complex algorithmic challenges in DSA.

Before tackling arrays, linked lists, trees, and algorithms, mastering patterns ensures you are comfortable with the syntax and logic required in C++.

### Contents

Each file in this directory demonstrates a unique pattern, such as:

- **Star Patterns**: Printing triangles, pyramids, diamonds, etc.
- **Number Patterns**: Sequences, pyramids, and other numeric arrangements.
- **Character Patterns**: Alphabet-based shapes and sequences.


Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.

### How to Run

To compile and run any pattern file, use the following commands in your terminal (Mac):

```bash
g++ pattern1.cpp -o pattern1
./pattern1
```

Replace `pattern1.cpp` with the desired file name.
